jqchat - IRC-like jQuery chat with PHP/MySQL backend
Demo @ http://xlator.htn.se/webh/jqchat

Installation:
Create a database and import jqchat.sql
Copy ajax/config.dist.php to ajax/config.php and enter your database settings

In-chat commands:
/nick SomeUser - Change nick to SomeUser
/topic Something Something Something - Change topic
/names - Get a list of active users
/me says hi - Send an emote (* SomeUser says hi)

NOTE:
When developing this application, I came across a bug in MySQL which is likely
to affect XAMPP users, but shouldn't bother you if you have a well configured
MySQL server. If you cannot send messages, check your my.cnf file.  The
"thread_stack" option should be set to at least 192K. This is due to a bug in
the way MySQL handles triggers, which I used to update the sessions table when
a user changes their nick.

TODO:
Nick registration/reservation (like authing to the service bot on your IRC network)
Multiple channels
Highlighting
Nick completion in messages
